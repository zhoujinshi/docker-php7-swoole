## Make your OpenSSH fly on Alpine

### Overview
Use this Dockerfile / -image to start a sshd-server upon a lightweight Alpine container.

### Features
* Always installs the latest OpenSSH-Version available for Alpine
* Password of "root"-user can be changed when starting the container using --env

### Basic Usage
```
$ docker run --rm \
-p 22:22 \
-e ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 \
zhoujinshi/alpine-sshd
```

After the container is up you are able to ssh in it as root with the in --env provided password for "root"-user.
```
$ ssh root@mydomain.tld -p 1337
```

### Use with docker-compose
I built this image in order to use it along with a nginx and fpm-php container for transferring files via sftp.
